## Introduction
Arguably one of the best streaming tools besides a camera, microphone, and lights is a Stream Deck, a macro keyboard with an LCD screen behind the buttons, which allows users to program custom shortcuts to control their streaming software and various other applications.  Unfortunately this surge in interest has made these devices either difficult to find or very expensive.  Because of this, I decided to create an open source version, which will hopefully make it easier for those interesting in streaming to go live online, and to make it possible for individuals to create the custom Stream Deck that best suits their streaming needs.

This repository contains code and icon templates required to build your own DIY Stream Deck.  Information found in this repository accompanies the "DIY Stream Deck" build video on the Super Make Something YouTube page, which can be found here.
